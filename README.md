Social Media Selector Menu

Social Media Selector Menu
This project provides a simple social media selector menu that allows users to select their preferred social media platform.

Installation
To use this project, simply download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and include them in your web project.

Usage
To use the social media selector menu, add the following HTML code to your web page:


<div class="social-media-selector">
  <button class="selected">Facebook</button>
  <button>Twitter</button>
  <button>Instagram</button>
</div>
Then, include the CSS and JavaScript files in your web page:


<link rel="stylesheet" href="social-media-selector-menu.css">
<script src="social-media-selector-menu.js"></script>
The first button in the menu will be selected by default. When a user clicks on another button, the previously selected button will be deselected and the newly clicked button will be selected.

You can customize the appearance of the social media selector menu by modifying the CSS code.
